## 🧠 How It Works

1. User signs up or logs into the platform.
2. User uploads their resume.
3. User enters job description details in sentence form.
4. Backend sends data to ML services.
5. NLP preprocessing extracts meaningful features.
6. Random Forest model evaluates compatibility.
7. Results are returned and displayed on the dashboard.
